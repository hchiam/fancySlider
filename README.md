# fancySlider

# Description:  
A fancy slider display that loops through text options stored in an array.

There are 3 sections:

1) Basic, original concept, using 5 cells of a table with varying font sizes & colours (with the central "selected" item bolded and with slight background colour).  

2) An extension of the original concept, but with 7 cells of a table, and alternation between using 4 or 5 cells to display, in order to give a more visual sense of "motion" of the options (as opposed to the basic original concept design in the 1st section).  

3) Another extension/variation, using a button to display the central "selected" option.  There is also an optional button underneath it (it does not seem possible to change the text size of button content right now [May 2016], so you may opt to use this "external" button instead using the "internal" button's content display the "selected" option's text).

# How to test out for use:  
Copy the code into your qdex document, between <document> and </document>.  You could try editing the text options manually or programmatically in separate function calls, for example.
