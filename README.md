# fancySlider

# Description:  
A fancy slider display that loops through text options stored in an array.

There are 3 sections:

1) Basic, original concept, using 5 cells of a table with varying font sizes & colours (with the central "selected" item bolded and with slight background colour).  

2) An extension of the original concept, but with 7 cells of a table, and alternation between using 4 or 5 cells to display, in order to give a more visual sense of "motion" of the options (as opposed to the basic original concept design in the 1st section).  

3) Another extension/variation, using a button to display the central "selected" option.  There is also an optional button underneath it (it does not seem possible to change the text size of button content right now in qdex [May 2016], so you may opt to use this "external" button instead using the "internal" button's content display the "selected" option's text).

# How to test out for use:  
Copy the code into your qdex document, between <document> and </document>.  You could try editing the text options manually or programmatically in separate function calls, for example.
